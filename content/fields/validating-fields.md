When writing field code, whether with Piklist or not, you should be extra cautious of how you handle data coming into WordPress and how it’s presented to the end user. Piklist makes validating your data easy with the `validate` parameter.

You can also create your own custom validation rules using the [piklist_validation_rules](https://docs.piklist.com/actions-filters/filters/piklist_validation_rules/) filter.

Choose the appropriate type of validation for each of your fields.

{{< show-validate >}}
